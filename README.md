# FindMyRecipe
NOTE: This is a WOIP, so it has a lot of bugs, and some features will soon be reconfigured.

Find recipes online
Searhc for recipes using food2fork api. Each recipe can be viewed in detail, with links to food2fork page and the original recipe.
The food2fork license included permits 500 fetches per day. Please use your own license if you intend to use this application. 
The applications is limited so that users will not be able to view their search history (due to caching of images). 
The "view instructions" link is not very helpful - it loads the recipe on food2fork. If you wish to view the instructions you 
would have to follow the link provided by food2fork site below the ingredients.

New version utilises MaterialSearchView, by Miguel Catalan Ba√±uls (https://github.com/MiguelCatalan/MaterialSearchView) - nice solution, easy to integrate. Also, search history is now available, and one can go back to previous searches.
